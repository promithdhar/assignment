            <p class="extra"><span class=number-1>1.</span><br></p> One line of code can have a significant impact on a website’s functionality or appearance, and web developers need to be sure they aren’t missing key details. When troubleshooting, they need to be able to know where to look for the problem.Projects aren’t always handled one at a time, and one client’s emergency sometimes can push another project to the backburner. Web developers need to be able to juggle multiple projects without missing deadlines</p>
            <p><span class="number-1">2.</span><br>Web developers work closely with project managers and designers to ensure that final products adhere to predetermined budgets, scope, and designs. Web developers sometimes need to be able to show employers or clients a prototype of a website to help them understand what the finished product will be.Website maintenance also is an important element of the job. As new features need to be added or old features need to be updated, web developers need to make sure these changes are implemented smoothly and that they do not disrupt the website’s features</p>
            <p><span class="number-1">3.</span><br>SEO is important for the smooth running of a big web site. Web sites with more than one author can benefit from SEO in a direct and indirect way. Their direct benefit is an increase in organic traffic and their indirect benefit is having a common framework (checklists) to use before publishing content on the site.SEO is good for the social promotion of your web site. People who find your website by searching Google or Bing are more likely to promote it on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media channels.</p>
